I will loop through each potential friend.

I figured out that the user placing their information in the form will always have the last object in the array, so i can just leave out the last object 
for comparison.


I will assign a name and a score using Math.abs() to make a basic difference no matter whether negative or positive. The smallest score should be the 
one to 
match with the user.
